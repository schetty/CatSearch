https://github.com/schetty/CatSearch/assets/16530138/a6d3dfd9-a1ce-4027-81a3-6e9d4c9e2930

View, search for and heart your favourite cat breeds to see your own personal selection of cat breeds! Online or offline :)

### Languages and Libraries Used

I used SwiftUI, SwiftData and Lottie to create a compact app for keeping track of favourite cat breeds.
Lottie for Loader animation, SwiftData for offline cacheing, SwiftDataStorage (to no success)

### Architecture Used
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

### API
I pulled cat breed data from thecatapi.com, to persist information about cats by breed in a ListView. The user can search for a cat breed with the search bar & then find more details about the selected cat + photos can be viewed on the following details page.
All cat data (not images) are cached locally so you can continue to explore cat breeds offline!


### TODOs
paginate list of cat breeds, add fuzzy search, add more animations, add tests, and build more personalised features for this fun cat app.
