Used SwiftUI, SwiftData and Lottie to create a compact app for keeping track of favourite cat breeds.

Using thecatapi.com, data about cats by breed is pulled and then presented on a ListView. Search for a cat breed with the search bar & then find more details about the selected cat + photos can be viewed on the following details page.

Heart your favourite cat breeds to see your own personal selection of cat breeds.

All cat data (not images) are cached locally so you can continue to explore cat breeds offline!

Architecture used: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Libraries used - Lottie for animations, SwiftData for offline cacheing, SwiftDataStorage (to no success)
TODOs: paginate list of cat breeds, add fuzzy search, add more animations, and build more personalized features for this fun cat app.
